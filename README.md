Tips and trics on how to use the terminal (or: command prompt) to make it appear to non-developer bystanders like you're in the matrix. 
The terminal is more than a place where you enter commands to your computer. You can count how often a word appears in a single file, pull a random Chuck Norris quote using the [Chuck Norris API][1], post a tweet from there or convert a large number of pictures to thumbnails. Just to name a few things. 
Plus: you don't need to install anything, as every computer has such a terminal thing. To get started, open 'terminalmatrix.markdown'!
